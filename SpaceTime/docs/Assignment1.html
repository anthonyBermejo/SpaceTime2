<h1>The Assignment</h1>

<p>Your assignment is to fill out the existing web application given the provided simplified
<a href="UseCases.txt">Use Cases</a>, <a href="DomainModel.png">Domain Model</a>, <a href="NonFunctionalRequirements.txt">NFRs</a>
and <a href="SampleResponses.txt">Sample Responses</a> that correspond to initial use cases. To guide you in this, a test suite
has been provided that should help you determine what your XML responses need to look like.</p>

<p>Note that the game does not have to work, you just need to have all the Use Cases specified working.</p>

<h1>Architectural Patterns</h1>
<p>You are expected to update your application with the new patterns we learn about. You only need to go as far as the October 21st
material, which is Lazy Load and Identity Map. Initial User and Player structures will be a bit ahead of what you have seen, and why they work
as they work may not yet be clear... but it should become clear.</p>

<p>You may make use of as much of SoenEA as you'd like, to this end. There is some
documentation for it, but it is crap and mostly in javadoc comments where it helps almost nobody... besides, for assignment one
it is a good idea to do some of this on your own... but you have that option, and some groups of students in the past have
profitably done this.</p>

<h1>A Starting Point</h1>
<p>To get you going, I have provided an <a href="SpaceTime.zip">initial web application</a> in the form of a jar that you can 
import into eclipse to create a starting project. I've created the empty Page Controllers (read Transaction Script for 
now) and a skeleton Player/User POJO. You need to create the 
rest, but can take guidance from the provided classes, tutorials and lectures. Following that directory structure will likely 
save you trouble in the future.</p>

<p>You'll also note that the initial project uses SoenEA a little bit. For your second assignment I'll want you to use SoenEA's
features more fully so I have less of a headache marking. For now, we'll stick to convenience things like DbRegistry that 
acts as a ThreadLocal and the SoenEA Servlet class which gives default behaviour to pipe post/get into processRequest and cleans
up said Database Connection so long as you're just using the default one. This means you HAVE TO put your DB credentials in
MyResources.properties. Take a look at how DBRegistry is used in the TDGs, and note that in AbstractPageController, the IMs from 
Player/User are cleaned up, as is the database connection. Also make sure that Setup and Teardown on org.soen387.test get updated to reflect
table creation and dropping, as this'll make the tests run nice.</p>

<h1>UI</h1>
<p>You are not technically required to make a front-end, as I'm not likely to manually mark things... but if things go South and 
 I have to manually walk through your application or give you a zero, I'm going to want to have an HTML front-end to make my
 life easier... at which point you'll want to use the mode=xml or some such to support xml interfaces like in the TDD tutorial.
 
<h1>Testing and Feedback</h1>
<p>Initially, testing will be thin. Look at the xml you output, maybe test a bit on your own. I'll provide a growing test suite
based on what I think is necessary and your feedback. You can update FieldMap.java to reflect how you interact 
with your application. I will copy what you have here into the test suite I use to mark, so you need to follow this interface so that
my test suite talks to your webapp properly or you'll likely get zero.</p> 

<p>I make mistakes, you make mistakes, but this process should let us both
resolve that silly stuff such that you are evaluated on your high level use/comprehension of the patterns, not on whether you 
can avoid typos.</p>

<h1>Final Inspirational Notes</h1>
<p>This Assignment is an individual assignment worth 10% of your grade. The assignment is due on November 6th, via the EAS system. 
Submit a zip/jar/war that includes all source files and structure. If I can't run it in a dynamic eclipse project with minimal effort, 
we have a problem.</p>
