<h1>The Assignment</h1>

<p>Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to fill out the existing web application given the provided simplified
<a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/UseCases.txt">Use Cases</a>, Domain Models  <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/SpaceTimePlayer.png">Player-centric</a> /
<a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/SpaceTimeNotification.png">Notification-centric</a>, <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/Requirements.txt">"Requirements"</a>, <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/NonFunctionalRequirements.txt">"NFRs"</a> 
and <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/SampleResponses.txt">Sample Responses that correspond to each use case</a>.</p>

<p>Note that SpaceTime does not have to work.</p>

<h1>Architectural Patterns</h1>
<p>You are expected to update your application with the new patterns we learn about. You only need to go as far as the 
November 25th material, which is the use of RESTful URLs and FrontController/Dispatcher/Commands, along with the previous 
advanced patterns.</p>

<p>You need to make use of SoenEA extensively in this assignment. You are expected to make use of the DomainObject, 
IDomainObject DomainObjectProxy facilities, as well as SoenEA's UoW (and accordingly GenericOutputMapper). You <b>must</b> make use 
of SoenEA's User and Role system, even if you only use the Guest Role (adjust MyResources.properties accordingly). You should be 
using SoenEA's base-classes for your FrontController, its PermaLink Filter and its DispatcherFactory/Dispatchers and abstract Command
Supertype. You are not required to use the Command Annotation system from SoenEA, but you'd be crazy not to.</p>

<h1>A Starting Point</h1>
<p>To get you going, I have provided a generic <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/SpaceTimeSolution.zip">Solution to Assignment 1</a> in the form of 
the org package as well as the jsp folder belonging in WEB-INF. I have also provided a <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sthiel/soen387/assignments/a2/SpaceTimeSolutionSOENEA.zip">SOENEA version</a> that uses the DomainObject/IDomainObject/DomainObjectProxy classes from SOENEA (including the already-made User DomainObject), uses the UoW as an IdentityMap (but not as a UoW, since that's not in A1) and makes use of the UniqueIdFactory default implementation. You should know what to do with these to make them work. You
may also start with your own Assignment 1 solution if you are happy with it, but please look at the solution to see and 
understand differences. Please try to maintain the directory structure, as it makes life easier for everyone.</p>

<p>SoenEA's PermalinkFilter uses an additional set of xml files and approaches that we'll go over in subsequent tutorials. Be
ready to accommodate this. Part of the goals of this assignment are to make you ask why things are a certain way and to 
pursue solutions given uncertainty... try to think of what would be sensible given the course material.</p>

<p>The test suite for Assignment 1 is included in the solution. Further tests will be forthcoming.</p>

<h1>UI</h1>
<p>You are not technically required to make a front-end, as I'm not likely to manually mark things... but if things go South and 
 I have to manually walk through your application or give you a zero, I'm going to want to have an HTML front-end to make my
 life easier... at which point you'll want to use the mode=xml or some such to support xml interfaces like in the TDD tutorial.
 
</p><h1>Testing and Feedback</h1>
<p>Initially, testing will be thin. Look at the xml you output, maybe test a bit on your own. I'll provide a growing test suite
based on what I think is necessary and your feedback. I make mistakes, you make mistakes, but this process should let us both
resolve that silly stuff such that you are evaluated on your high level use/comprehension of the patterns, not on whether you 
can avoid typos.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Final Inspirational Notes</h1>
<p>This Assignment is an <b>Individual Assignment</b> worth <b>10%</b> of your grade. The assignment is due on December 8th. Don't wait till 
the last few days!.</p>
